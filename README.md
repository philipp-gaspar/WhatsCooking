# What's Cooking

Repository for the analysis for the [What's Cooking Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking) where we use ingredients to categorize a particular cuisine.

## Downloading the Dataset

We will use the **Kaggle API** to download the dataset directly from the command line. One can follow the instructions on how to install and create an API Credential [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api). After the installation, we can download the dataset for the competition by running `bash download.sh` inside the `data` folder.
